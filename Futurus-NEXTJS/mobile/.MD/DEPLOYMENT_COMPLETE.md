## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Login to Vercel

Since Vercel requires authentication, run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/galo/PROJECTS/sportcenter.space/mobile/template
vercel login
```

**What this does:**

- Opens browser for authentication
- Generates secure token
- Saves credentials locally

**Choose authentication method:**

- GitHub account (recommended)
- GitLab account
- Bitbucket account
- Email (sends magic link)

### Step 2: Deploy to Production

After logging in, deploy with one command:

```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

**Expected output:**

```
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/...
✅  Production: https://futurus-xxx.vercel.app [copied to clipboard]
```

**Deployment time:** ~30 seconds

---

## 🌐 What You'll Get

After deployment, you'll have:

**Live URL:** `https://futurus-xxx.vercel.app`

**Features:**

- ✅ Automatic HTTPS/SSL certificate
- ✅ Global CDN (100+ locations)
- ✅ Automatic cache optimization
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments
- ✅ Instant rollback capability
- ✅ Custom domain support

---

## 📱 Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these features:

### Desktop Testing

1. Open the Vercel URL in your browser
2. ✅ Products should load
3. ✅ Add items to cart
4. ✅ Add items to wishlist
5. ✅ Navigate between pages
6. ✅ Check responsive design (resize window)

### Mobile Testing

1. Open URL on your phone
2. ✅ Tap products
3. ✅ Add to cart
4. ✅ Navigation should work
5. ✅ Touch targets should be large enough

### API Testing

⚠️ **Important:** The app is configured to use:

```
https://api.futurus.com.br/api
```

**If this API is not deployed yet:**

1. Deploy your backend API first
2. Update `.env.production` with the correct URL
3. Rebuild: `pnpm run web:export`
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

---

## 🔧 Alternative: Deploy Script

You can also use the interactive deployment script:

```bash
./deploy-web.sh
```

**What it does:**

1. Checks if build exists (rebuilds if needed)
2. Asks which platform (Vercel/Netlify/Firebase/GitHub Pages)
3. Handles login if needed
4. Deploys automatically

---

## 🌍 Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment, you can add a custom domain:

### Via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to Settings → Domains
4. Add domain: `futurus.com.br` or `www.futurus.com.br`

### Update DNS

Add CNAME record:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: Auto
```

**SSL Certificate:** Automatic (Let's Encrypt)

## 🔄 Rebuild & Redeploy

If you make changes, rebuild and redeploy:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes to code

# 2. Rebuild
pnpm run web:export

# 3. Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

**Or use the short version:**

```bash
pnpm run web:export && vercel --prod
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "The specified token is not valid"

**Solution:** Run `vercel login` first

### "404 Not Found" on routes

**Solution:** Already configured in vercel.json ✅

### API calls return errors

**Check:**

1. Is backend API deployed?
2. Is API URL correct in `.env.production`?
3. Does backend have CORS enabled?
4. Test API endpoint manually:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.futurus.com.br/api/products
   ```

### Build is too large

**Normal:** React Native web bundles are ~5MB
**Optimizations:**

- Vercel automatically enables gzip compression
- CDN caching reduces load times
- First load: ~5MB, subsequent loads: cached
